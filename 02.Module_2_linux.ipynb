The terminal is the program that provides a graphical interface where users can enter commands that are converted into binary code by the shell to be executed by the computer via kernel. We use a terminal (AKA command line interface) to interact with the operating system. The terminal by default runs one of the “shells”. Shell is a program that sits between the user and the kernel (allows interaction between the hardware and the software in a computer), and translates user commands into machine code. The advantages of using the command line are greater control and flexibility over the system or software. Moreover, multiple commands can be saved in a file and executed as a script. \n",

You can think of directories as rooms in a house. You can only be in one room (directory) at a time. When you are in a room you can see everything in that room easily. To see things in other rooms, you have to go to the appropriate door and crane your head around. UNIX works in a similar manner, moving from directory to directory to access files.
